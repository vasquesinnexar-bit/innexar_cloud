# Payment Platform Comparison (Feb 2026)

Detailed comparison across three platform layers: processors (Stripe, Adyen), merchants of record (Paddle, LemonSqueezy), and billing orchestrators (Chargebee, Recurly, Lago). Plus mobile (RevenueCat) and deprecation warnings (Braintree).

                                    Subscription Context
                                    (React Context / API middleware)

## RevenueCat

**Best for:** Mobile apps with in-app subscriptions (iOS + Android).

### Strengths
- Wraps both App Store and Google Play billing
- Unified API for cross-platform subscriptions
- Experiments/A/B testing for pricing
- Detailed subscription analytics (MRR, churn, LTV)

### Hybrid Pattern (RevenueCat + Stripe)

For apps with both mobile and web users:

```typescript
// Mobile: RevenueCat handles App Store / Google Play
// Web: Stripe handles checkout and billing
// Backend: Unified user subscription state

// When RevenueCat webhook fires:
if (event.type === 'INITIAL_PURCHASE') {
  await db.subscriptions.upsert({
    user_id: event.app_user_id,
    platform: 'mobile',
    tier: mapRevenueCatToPlan(event.product_id),
    status: 'active',
  });
}

// When Stripe webhook fires:
if (event.type === 'customer.subscription.created') {
  await db.subscriptions.upsert({
    user_id: event.data.object.metadata.user_id,
    platform: 'web',
    tier: getTierFromPriceId(event.data.object.items.data[0].price.id),
    status: 'active',
  });
}
```

## Adyen

**Best for:** Enterprise businesses, high-volume processors (>$1M/yr), companies needing 250+ local payment methods.

### Strengths
- Largest local payment method coverage (250+ methods globally)
- Interchange++ pricing (transparent, lower at high volume)
- Unified platform: online, in-app, and point-of-sale
- Adyen for Platforms (marketplace/multi-party equivalent to Stripe Connect)
- Strong in APAC, LATAM, and EMEA local methods
- Used by Uber, Spotify, eBay, Microsoft

### Weaknesses
- Complex setup — not suitable for startups or low-volume businesses
- No built-in subscription billing (pair with Chargebee/Recurly)
- Less developer-friendly documentation compared to Stripe
- Interchange++ pricing model can be confusing for small teams
- Limited self-serve — requires sales engagement for onboarding

### Pricing
- Interchange++ (transaction processing fee + scheme fee + Adyen markup)
- No monthly minimums for online payments
- Volume-dependent — gets cheaper at scale
- Typical effective rate: 1.5-2.5% for high-volume EU transactions

### When to Choose Adyen Over Stripe
- Processing >$1M/yr (interchange++ becomes cheaper than Stripe flat rate)
- Need local payment methods in APAC/LATAM that Stripe doesn't support
- Unified online + point-of-sale on one platform
- Enterprise compliance requirements (SOC 2 Type II, PCI Level 1)

## Chargebee (Billing Orchestrator)

**Best for:** B2B SaaS with complex billing logic — per-seat, usage-based, contract billing, multi-currency invoicing.

### Strengths

- Quote-to-cash workflow for B2B sales-led deals
- 100+ integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Xero, QuickBooks)
- Hosted checkout pages and customer portal included

### Weaknesses
- Usage-based billing limited to 5,000 records per subscription lifetime
- Adds a billing layer = additional vendor and cost
- Can be overkill for simple tier-based SaaS
- Chargebee-managed dunning may conflict with Stripe's built-in dunning

### Pricing
- Startup: Free (up to $250K revenue)
- Performance: 0.75% of revenue
- Enterprise: custom
- Plus processor fees (Stripe/Adyen) on top

### When to Choose Chargebee

- Need revenue recognition / ASC 606 compliance
- Sales-led with custom contracts and quotes
- Outgrowing hand-rolled subscription logic on top of Stripe

---

## Recurly (Billing Orchestrator)

- Multi-gateway support (Stripe, Adyen, Braintree, Worldpay)
- Flexible pricing models (flat, tiered, usage, ramp)

### Weaknesses

- Churn reduction is your top priority
- Need best-in-class dunning automation
- Prefer US-based support

## Lago (Open-Source Billing)

**Best for:** AI/ML SaaS with usage-based pricing, developer-tools companies, teams wanting billing logic in their own infrastructure.

### Strengths
- Open-source (MIT license), self-hostable
- Purpose-built for usage-based billing (API calls, AI tokens, compute, storage)
- Real-time metering with aggregation engine
- Composable pricing: flat + usage + per-seat in one plan
- Event-driven architecture (scales to billions of events)
- Growing fast in AI/developer-tools space

### Weaknesses
- Younger platform (less battle-tested than Chargebee/Recurly)

## Braintree (DEPRECATED — Avoid for New Projects)

> **WARNING (Feb 2026):** Braintree Drop-in SDK moves to unsupported status July 14, 2026. PayPal Powered by Braintree processing ends January 2027. SSL certificates for mobile SDKs expire March 30, 2026.

**Migration paths:**
- For PayPal payments → Use Stripe's PayPal payment method or PayPal Commerce Platform directly
- For card processing → Migrate to Stripe or Adyen
- For Venmo → PayPal Commerce Platform

Do NOT start new projects on Braintree.

| Indie developer, digital products | LemonSqueezy |
| Mobile app subscriptions | RevenueCat |
| Marketplace / multi-party payments | Stripe Connect or Adyen for Platforms |
| B2B invoicing | Stripe Invoicing |
| Complex subscription logic (per-seat + usage) | Chargebee on top of Stripe |
| B2C subscriptions, churn focus | Recurly on top of Stripe |
| Usage-based pricing (simple) | Stripe Billing Meters |
| Usage-based pricing (complex, AI tokens) | Lago (open-source) or Chargebee |
| Already on Stripe, need MoR | Wait for Stripe Managed Payments GA |
| Need it working today with MoR | Paddle |
| Hybrid mobile + web | RevenueCat (mobile) + Stripe (web) |

---

## Migration Paths

### Stripe -> Paddle
- Export customer data from Stripe
- Create Paddle products/prices to match
- Migrate active subscriptions gradually (honor current billing periods)
- Update webhook endpoints

### LemonSqueezy -> Stripe
- Natural since LemonSqueezy is Stripe-powered
- May get migration tools as Stripe integrates the acquisition

### Stripe -> Stripe Managed Payments
- Expected to be a configuration change, not a full migration
- Opt-in on existing Stripe account
- Stripe handles tax + fraud + disputes going forward

---

## Stripe Managed Payments (MoR) — 2025+

Stripe announced **Managed Payments** in 2025 as a merchant of record offering, expanding through 2026:

- Stripe handles global tax compliance (VAT in 100+ countries)
- AI-driven fraud prevention with Smart Disputes (+13% chargeback win rate)
- Transaction-level customer support
- Expanding from private preview for subscription SaaS and digital goods (NA + EU)
- Acquired LemonSqueezy in 2024 to build this capability
- Expected to be a configuration toggle on existing Stripe accounts (not a full migration)

**Decision: Stripe MoR vs Paddle vs LemonSqueezy**

| Factor | Stripe Managed Payments | Paddle | LemonSqueezy |
|--------|------------------------|--------|--------------|
| Tax handling | Included | Included | Included |
| Ecosystem | Full Stripe ecosystem | Standalone | Stripe-powered |
| Pricing | TBD (likely % + fee) | 5% + 50c | 5% + 50c |
| API flexibility | Full Stripe API | Paddle API | Simpler API |
| Maturity | Private preview | Production | Production |
| Best for | Already on Stripe | Established SaaS | Indie/small SaaS |

## RevenueCat Integration (Mobile)

For mobile apps with in-app subscriptions:

```typescript
// RevenueCat SDK initialization (React Native)
import Purchases from 'react-native-purchases';

Purchases.configure({
  apiKey: REVENUECAT_API_KEY,
  appUserID: userId, // Match your backend user ID
});

// Check entitlements
const customerInfo = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo();
const isPro = customerInfo.entitlements.active['pro'] !== undefined;

// Purchase
const offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
const package = offerings.current?.availablePackages[0];
if (package) {
  const result = await Purchases.purchasePackage(package);
}
```
