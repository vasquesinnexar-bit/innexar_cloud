## Tier 1: Self-Serve, Full Coverage

### GoCardless

**What:** Direct Debit specialist (UK Bacs, SEPA, ACH, BECS, PAD). Collects recurring payments by pulling directly from bank accounts — lower fees than card payments, near-zero involuntary churn.

**Signup:** Self-serve at gocardless.com. UK company or sole trader. KYC typically < 24h.

**Pricing (Feb 2026):**
- UK Bacs: 1% + 20p (capped at GBP 4)
- SEPA: 1% + 20c (capped at EUR 4)
- ACH: 1% + 30c (capped at USD 5)
- No monthly fee on Standard plan

**API pattern:**

```typescript
// GoCardless payment flow (server-side)
import gocardless from 'gocardless-nodejs';

const client = gocardless(process.env.GOCARDLESS_ACCESS_TOKEN!, {
  environment: gocardless.Environments.Live,
});

// 1. Create a Billing Request Flow (hosted mandate setup)
const billingRequestFlow = await client.billingRequestFlows.create({
  redirect_uri: `${appUrl}/mandate/complete`,
  exit_uri: `${appUrl}/mandate/cancel`,
  links: {
    billing_request: billingRequest.id,
  },
});

// 2. After mandate setup, create recurring payment
const payment = await client.payments.create({
  amount: 999,         // in pence
  currency: 'GBP',
  links: { mandate: mandateId },
  metadata: { user_id: userId, invoice_id: invoiceId },
});
```

**Webhooks:** Signed with `Webhook-Signature` header. Key events: `payments.confirmed`, `payments.failed`, `mandates.cancelled`.

**Best for:** Recurring B2B/B2C with predictable amounts. Gym memberships, SaaS with annual DD, utility-style billing. Pairs well with Stripe for card fallback.
