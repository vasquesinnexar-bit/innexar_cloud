## Review Scope Rule

Review **only new or modified code** in the merge request, not the entire repository.

- Feedback must be limited to changes in the diff unless new code directly interacts with existing components where consistency is important
- Do not comment on untouched legacy code
- If context from unchanged files is needed, read it but do not critique it

This rule prevents scope creep and keeps reviews focused and actionable.

## Severity Ratings

Use consistent severity labels to help authors prioritize:

- **P0 (Critical)**: Security vulnerability, data loss risk, funds at risk, immediate exploit possible
- **P1 (High)**: Correctness bug, missing error handling, complex exploit path
- **P2 (Medium)**: Performance issue, logic error, gas inefficiency, poor UX
- **P3 (Low)**: Code quality, naming, style, documentation, best practices

Mark P0/P1 as **REQUIRED** fixes. Mark P2/P3 as **SUGGESTION** or **OPTIONAL**.

## DORA Metrics for Code Review (2025-2026)

Track these metrics to measure review effectiveness:

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Deployment Frequency | How often code deploys | Daily to weekly |
| Lead Time for Changes | Commit to production | <1 day |
| Change Failure Rate | Deployments causing issues | <15% |
| Time to Restore | Recovery from failures | <1 hour |
| **Rework Rate (2025)** | Unplanned production fixes | Track trend, minimize |

### AI Impact on Reviews (2025-2026)

Industry reporting suggests AI-assisted coding often increases PR size and review load. Treat specific metrics as directional and re-verify before using them for policy decisions (see `data/sources.json`).

**Implications for teams (stable guidance):**

- Keep PRs small and reviewable (split large changes; prefer stacked PRs when appropriate)
- Allocate review time explicitly when changes are AI-generated or unfamiliar
- Use automation (linters/SAST/SCA/tests) to reduce reviewer cognitive load
- Track rework rate and change failure rate to detect quality regressions

## Core Review Checklist (Inline)

Use this checklist as a baseline for any review:

- Correctness: logic matches requirements, handles edge cases
- Security: input validation, auth, access control checks
- Reliability: error handling, retries, timeouts where needed
- Performance: obvious hot paths, unnecessary work, N+1 patterns
- Readability: clear naming, small functions, consistent style
- Standards: cite `CC-*` IDs instead of restating clean code rules ([../../software-clean-code-standard/references/clean-code-standard.md](../../software-clean-code-standard/references/clean-code-standard.md))
- Tests: coverage for happy path, errors, and regression cases

---

## Review Modes

Choose the mode that matches the task:

- Safety review: focus on security, data handling, privacy, and dangerous operations (deletes, money movement, external calls).
- Design review: focus on boundaries, abstractions, and how the code fits the architecture.
- Maintainability review: focus on readability, duplication, naming, and complexity.
- Performance review: focus on hot paths, database access, allocations, and unnecessary work.
- Test review: focus on coverage, flakiness, and meaningful assertions.

Explicitly note which mode(s) you are applying so comments stay coherent.

---

## Simplicity and Complexity Controls

- Prefer library and platform capabilities over custom code when behavior is equivalent.
- Remove dead/commented-out code and collapse duplication (DRY) before layering new logic.
- Keep functions/classes single-purpose; split large modules before adding features.
- Avoid premature optimization; tune based on profiling evidence, not intuition.
- Schedule incremental refactors alongside risky changes to prevent complexity creep.

---

## Pattern: Pull Request Review Workflow

Use this pattern for PR-based reviews.

1. Context
   - Read the PR description, issue link, and acceptance criteria.
   - Identify risk areas (security, data migration, public APIs).
2. High-level scan
   - Look at changed files and folders first, not individual lines.
   - Confirm the change shape matches the description (no surprise changes).
3. Deep review
   - Walk file-by-file in a stable order.
   - Apply the core checklist: correctness → security → reliability → performance → readability → tests.
4. Tests
   - Check that new behavior has tests.
   - Check that risky paths have regression coverage.
5. Feedback
   - Group comments by theme (bugs, design, style, tests).
   - Clearly distinguish REQUIRED vs NICE-TO-HAVE.

Review comment template:

- Summary: what this change does, risk level.
- Strengths: what is working well.
- Required changes: correctness, security, reliability issues.
- Suggested improvements: design, naming, structure, tests.

---

## Pattern: Security-Focused Review

Use when code touches authentication, authorization, input handling, secrets, or external integrations.

- Inputs:
  - Validate all external inputs (HTTP, CLI, file, message queue).
  - Prefer whitelists over blacklists.
- Auth and access control:
  - Confirm authentication is required where expected.
  - Ensure authorization checks run on every sensitive operation.
- Data handling:
  - Avoid logging secrets, tokens, or personal data.
  - Ensure encryption/transport security is handled at the right layer.
- Dangerous operations:
  - Confirm explicit confirmation or safeguards for deletes, payments, or irreversible operations.

When security concerns dominate, pair this skill with:

- [software-security-appsec](../../software-security-appsec/SKILL.md) for OWASP Top 10, authentication, authorization, input validation, and cryptography patterns.
- [ai-mlops](../../ai-mlops/SKILL.md) for LLM/ML safety and threat models.

---

## Pattern: Test-Gap Review

Use this when a change is large or risky.

- Map behaviors:
  - For each new or changed behavior, ask: "Where is this tested?"
- Check test types:
  - Unit tests: core logic functions.
  - Integration tests: modules talking to DBs, queues, or external APIs.
  - E2E or system tests: critical user flows.
- Validate assertions:
  - Tests assert both happy path and failure behavior.
  - Tests check boundaries (empty lists, large values, invalid inputs).

If tests are missing:
- Call out missing coverage as REQUIRED when bugs would be likely or high impact.
- Suggest concrete test cases and where to put them.

---

## Pattern: Refactor-Suggestion Review

Use when the code is correct but could be simpler.

- Start with correctness: never propose refactors that change behavior without acknowledgment.
- Suggest incremental improvements:
  - Extract functions to reduce duplication.
  - Rename variables and functions for clarity.
  - Reduce nested branching and long functions.
- Use neutral, constructive language:
  - "Consider extracting this block into a helper for readability."
  - "This condition could be inverted to reduce nesting."

Mark refactor suggestions as OPTIONAL unless they impact correctness or maintainability significantly.
