## Readability & Maintainability (10% focus)

Use the clean code standard as the single source of truth. In review comments, cite `CC-*` IDs instead of restating rules:

- Standard: [../../software-clean-code-standard/references/clean-code-standard.md](../../software-clean-code-standard/references/clean-code-standard.md)
- Common categories: `CC-NAM` (naming), `CC-FUN` (functions), `CC-FLOW` (control flow), `CC-ERR` (errors), `CC-DOC` (docs)

Prefer automation for formatting and mechanical style enforcement; use human review time on correctness, risk, and intent.

## Testing (Critical - must be comprehensive)

### Test Coverage
- [ ] New functionality has tests
- [ ] Critical paths have 100% coverage
- [ ] Business logic has 90%+ coverage
- [ ] Overall coverage ≥80%
- [ ] Changed code paths are tested

### Test Types
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for component interactions
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows
