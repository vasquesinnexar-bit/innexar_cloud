## Breach Cost Modeling (2024-2025 Data)

### IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024

| Metric | Global Average | US Average | Healthcare |
|--------|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Average breach cost** | $4.88M | $9.36M | $10.93M |
| **Cost per record** | $165 | $194 | $408 |
| **Breach lifecycle** | 277 days | 258 days | 213 days |
| **Detection time** | 204 days | 191 days | 156 days |
| **Containment time** | 73 days | 67 days | 57 days |

### Cost Amplifiers

| Factor | Cost Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| Security skills shortage | +$1.76M |
| Compliance failures | +$1.08M |
| Cloud migration | +$0.75M |
| IoT/OT involvement | +$0.87M |
| Third-party breach | +$0.87M |
| Lost business | 38% of total cost |

### Cost Reducers (ROI Justification)

| Control | Cost Reduction | Implementation Cost |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **DevSecOps adoption** | -$1.68M (-34%) | $150K-300K/year |
| **AI/ML security tools** | -$1.76M (-36%) | $200K-500K/year |
| **Incident response team** | -$2.26M (-46%) | $400K-800K/year |
| **Employee training** | -$232K (-5%) | $50K-100K/year |
| **Encryption (extensive)** | -$168K (-3%) | $100K-200K/year |
| **Security analytics** | -$180K (-4%) | $150K-250K/year |

### ROI Formula

```text
Security ROI = (Risk Reduction - Security Investment) / Security Investment × 100

Where:
- Risk Reduction = (Breach Probability × Average Breach Cost) × Control Effectiveness
- Example: (15% × $4.88M) × 46% reduction = $337K risk reduction
- Investment: $400K IR team
- ROI: ($337K - $400K) / $400K = -16% Year 1
- Break-even: Year 2+ as probability compounds
```

### Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) Model

```text
ALE = SLE × ARO

Where:
- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) = Asset Value × Exposure Factor
- ARO (Annual Rate of Occurrence) = Probability of incident per year

Example: Database breach
- Asset Value: $50M (customer data, reputation)
- Exposure Factor: 30% (expected loss)
- SLE: $15M
- ARO: 5% (industry average for unprotected systems)
- ALE: $750K/year

With controls (ARO reduced to 0.5%):
- New ALE: $75K/year
- Risk Reduction: $675K/year
- Acceptable security investment: Up to $675K/year
```

## Security as Enterprise Sales Enabler

### Compliance → Contract Requirements

| Compliance | Enterprise Requirement | Deal Size Impact |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **SOC 2 Type II** | Common enterprise procurement baseline | Enables $100K+ deals |
| **ISO 27001** | Often expected in EU/regulated markets | Enables $250K+ deals |
| **HIPAA** | Required for many healthcare use cases | Enables healthcare vertical |
| **PCI DSS** | Required for many payment processing flows | Enables fintech partnerships |
| **FedRAMP** | Required for many US federal workloads | Enables $1M+ government deals |
| **GDPR** | EU data processing | Required for EU market entry |

### Sales Cycle Impact

| Security Posture | Typical Sales Impact |
|------------------|-----------------|
| No formal attestation | Longer security reviews and higher drop-off |
| SOC 2 Type I | Sometimes acceptable for pilots; often requires a roadmap to Type II |
| SOC 2 Type II | Smoother enterprise procurement and renewals |
| ISO 27001 + SOC 2 | Strong trust signal, especially in regulated/geographically strict markets |

### Security Questionnaire Acceleration

**Problem:** Security questionnaires average 200-400 questions, 40-80 hours to complete.

**Solution:** Pre-built evidence library

| Control | Evidence Package |
|---------|------------------|
| Access management | IAM policies, RBAC docs, access reviews |
| Encryption | TLS configs, encryption-at-rest policies, key management |
| Incident response | IR playbooks, tabletop exercises, breach notification procedures |
| Vendor management | Third-party risk assessments, vendor security reviews |
| Change management | CI/CD security gates, code review requirements |

**ROI:** Can materially reduce questionnaire time and speed procurement; measure impact in your CRM (cycle time, win rate, and effort hours).
