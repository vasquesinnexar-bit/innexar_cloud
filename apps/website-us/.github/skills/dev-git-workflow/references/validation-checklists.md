## Merge Strategy Checklist

### Choose Merge Strategy

**Squash and Merge** - When:
- [ ] Feature branch with many WIP commits
- [ ] Want single commit in history
- [ ] PR is self-contained feature

**Rebase and Merge** - When:
- [ ] Commits are already clean and logical
- [ ] Want to preserve individual commits
- [ ] Linear history preferred

**Merge Commit** - When:
- [ ] Want to preserve branch context
- [ ] Multiple developers collaborated
- [ ] Shared feature branch

### Before Merging

- [ ] Chosen merge strategy aligns with team policy
- [ ] Commit message follows conventions (if squashing)
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with base
- [ ] All checks pass

## Stacked Diffs Checklist

### Planning Stack

- [ ] Feature broken into logical increments
- [ ] Each stack is independently reviewable
- [ ] Each stack is < 400 lines
- [ ] Clear dependency order established
- [ ] Stack naming convention followed

### Creating Stack

- [ ] Base branch created from main
- [ ] Each stack builds on previous
- [ ] PR descriptions explain stack position
- [ ] Dependency chain documented

### Reviewing Stack

- [ ] Review bottom-up (base first)
- [ ] Each stack approved before next
- [ ] Maintain stack integrity during updates
- [ ] Rebase chain when needed

### Merging Stack

- [ ] Merge bottom-up (base first)
- [ ] Update subsequent PRs after each merge
- [ ] Verify tests pass after each merge
- [ ] Monitor for cascading issues

## Rebase Checklist

### Before Rebasing

- [ ] Understand what rebase does (rewrites history)
- [ ] Confirm branch is not shared with others
- [ ] Backup branch if unsure (`git branch backup`)
- [ ] Fetch latest changes from base

### During Rebase

- [ ] Resolve conflicts carefully
- [ ] Verify each commit after conflict resolution
- [ ] Test after rebase completes
- [ ] Ensure commit messages still make sense

### After Rebase

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Force push safely (`--force-with-lease`)
- [ ] Verify history looks correct (`git log`)
- [ ] Update PR if needed

### Never Rebase If

- [ ] Commits already on main/master
- [ ] Branch is shared with teammates
- [ ] You're not confident in the process
- [ ] Protected branch (use merge instead)
